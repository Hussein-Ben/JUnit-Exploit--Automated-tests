# Instructions

A frustrated developer may be given a unit test they need to pass to meet urgent and stressful deadlines.

Or a University student or Programming applicant and you need to pass their automated marking software (which will most likely use JUnit, just look at any error messages you get)

**At an end of any function, before the return statement, insert;**

    System.exit(0);

Your code will pass all tests. Exit code 0 means the program was successful, here are some other exit codes for Java; 

|Exit code| Meaning in Java |
|--|--|
| 0 | No error. The command executed successfully, **be careful** of the  `SecurityException` If a [security manager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#exit-int-) is present in the test code, it has a `checkExit` method which "does not permit exiting with the specified status", unlikely a test will have a security manager but you should have a look|
| -1 | A registry key or file required for Command Manager was not found |
| 1 | Command Manager was unable to load and prepare its operating environment. |
| 3 | Your Command Manager license has expired. You can view license information in License Manager. |
| 4 | Command Manager was unable to establish a connection to Intelligence Server. |
| 5 | Command Manager was unable to establish a connection to Narrowcast Server. |
| 6 | The statement contained a syntax error. |
| 8 | Intelligence Server returned an error. |
| 9 | Narrowcast Server returned an error. |
| 10 | A file-related operation failed. For example, the script may have tried to write to a read-only file, or read from a file that does not exist. |
| 15 | The execute statement does not contain a Command Manager statement to be executed. |


# Avoid detection

To avoid a human seeing “System._exit_(0);” in your code, you can move the statement all the way to the end of a screen, the computer will still execute your code.

__ [Many space-bar presses] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __________________________									                 System._exit_(0);

This exploit will work with any Java version, it could also work with JavaScript but it hasn’t been tested in JavaScript environment yet.

# Works with...

Exploit has proven to work with [INGInious](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious) a automated code assessment platform.
